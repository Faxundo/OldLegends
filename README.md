The old legends echo again in the world. It's time to remember the greatest in history.
This is my first public mod. Any help or suggestions is well received.

# Freatures:
- Very customizable. 
- Add 3 new items.
- Add 2 new weapons:
  - **Emerald Mourning**: Is a powerful sword with 2 passive abilities and 1 active ability.
  - **Swallows Storm**: A mystic shield with 3 passive abilities and 1 active ability.
- Unique mechanic of old legends items: **Awake**. 

## Awake
Restore old legends and unleash their true power. For this, you need new 2 items: Pale Gem and  End Extract.
- **Pale Gem**: You can dig up it with a Brush at archaeological sites.
- **End Extract**: You can get this every time you defeat the Ender Dragon.

With 1 Pale Gem and 4 Netherite Ingots, you craft the **Awakening Upgrade**

Then put the Old Legend Item, Awakening Upgrade and End Extract in the Smithing Table.
