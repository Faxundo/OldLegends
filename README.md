![Reliquary](src/main/resources/presentation/reliquary_1.png)

The reliquary is a container block like a chest but only has 3 slot.

You only can put sparkly items inside this. When the night comes and you lock the reliquary (00:00) the Grinning
Hoarders take them and recompense you for these treasures.

Each sparkly item has a different value, and you can see that in the wiki o you can discover your self. To each slot
exits a multiplier what applied to the item.

City or Strongholds.
